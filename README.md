# My Portfolio

This portfolio webpage was created by utilizing the css framework, Bootstrap, to create a responsive design. Included in this page are links in the Navbar to the following HTML pages: About Me, Portfolio, & Contact. "About Me" contains images of myself, a desciption, & a downloadable link to my resume. The "Portfolio" page contains images & links to all my projects and their code. And the "Contact" page conatins a form for users (hopefully future employers) to input their contact information. Additionally, the design of the page re-adjusts depending on the screen resolution. The validation service, W3C Markup Validation Service, was used to double check my HTML files for any errors.
