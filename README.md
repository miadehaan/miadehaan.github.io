# My Portfolio

This portfolio webpage was created by utilizing the css framework, Bootstrap, to create a responsive design. Included in this page are links in the Navbar to the following HTML pages: About Me, Portfolio, & Contact. "About Me" contains an image and desciption about myself. The "Portfolio" page contains images of where all my future projects will be. And the "Contact" page conatins a form for users (hopefully future employers) to input their contact information. Additionally, the design of the page re-adjusts depending on the screen resolution. The validation service, W3C Markup Validation Service, was used to double check my HTML files for any errors.
